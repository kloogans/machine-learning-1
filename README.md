A lightweight app that uses machine learning to detect selected color names
and their complimentary colors. It uses brain.js to train and run a neural network
to determine color names from inputted RGB data.

## Tech
- ReactJS
- brain.js

## Install
- Clone project
- `npm install` or `yarn`
- `npm run start` or `yarn start`

*Will not work in Safari for now, which does not support HTML5 color input type.*
