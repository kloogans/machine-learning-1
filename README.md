A lightweight app that uses machine learning to detect selected color names
and their complimentary colors. It uses brain.js to train and run a neural network
to determine color names from inputted RGB data.

## Tech
- ReactJS
- brain.js

## Install

*Will not work in Safari for now, which does not support HTML color input types.*
